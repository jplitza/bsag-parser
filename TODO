These are some ideas that might or might not get implemented some time...

GUI:
* more info on route page
* favourites
* "link" to result page
* configurable defaults
* add i18n
* portrait mode
* add times to calendar/alarm

Widget:
* create it

Backend:
* discover more error msgs
* support realtime
* fix dates
